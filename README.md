# Toon Fit: Interactive Exergame for Kids

## Inspiration
As a kid, I spent hours glued to the screen, watching cartoons—but what if I could have been learning and moving at the same time? That question sparked the idea for this exergame. In today’s digital world, kids are more passive than ever, so I wanted to create something that makes screen time active and engaging. This game transforms cartoons into an interactive adventure, where kids don’t just watch—they jump, squat, reach, and move to play and learn. By blending fun physical challenges with storytelling, this game turns exercise into excitement and learning into a full-body experience!

## What it does
- **Interactive Cartoons**: Transforms cartoons into interactive learning experiences.
- **Active Participation**: Encourages physical activity through fun movements like jumping, squatting, and reaching.
- **Movement-Based Learning**: Kids answer questions and solve puzzles by performing different physical challenges.
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks progress, rewarding both physical activity and knowledge.
- **Parental Control**: Parents can check their kids' performance, data analysis with graphs, and receive feedback from "Gemini".
- **ChatBot**: Features a Gemini-powered chatbot that can assist parents with parenting by answering their queries 24x7.

## How we built it
**Tools & Libraries:**  
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Framework, Gemini API, IntelliJ IDEA, MySQL  
- **Frontend**: React.js, Node.js, TypeScript  
- **Machine Learning**: MediaPipe, NumPy, Flask  

We created the website (frontend) and connected it with our backend (server). We had to create two servers:  
1. **Spring Framework (Java)**: Handles authorization and manages external APIs.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Integration Difficulty**: One of us created a server using the Spring framework, hosted on his laptop, while the other hosted the website on their laptop. We found it really difficult to integrate the two because the server was not accessible from the outside, making it hard to connect the website and server.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We finished the project according to our plan, even though we had to sacrifice sleep along the way.

## What we learned
- **Integration Skills**: We worked together with three different languages and numerous tools, learning how to integrate them seamlessly.
- **Game Development**: This was our first time building a game, and it was a great learning experience since we all are web developers.

## What's next for Toon Fit
- **Intellectually Challenging Games**: We will add games that are mentally and intellectually challenging, not just physically.
- **Online Multiplayer**: We will add an online multiplayer option to make the game more engaging.
- **AI Integration**: We want to integrate a powerful AI model. Parents will be able to choose a video topic, and our model will generate a set of questions based on that topic.
